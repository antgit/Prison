# Prison

The jailer goes into a secret room and prepares 100 boxes with lids. He labels these boxes 1-100. Then he prepares 100 tickets, one for each prisoner, and labels these tickets 1-100. Finally, he shuffles the tickets thoroughly, and puts one ticket in each box, closing the lid behind it. The prisoners cannot see any of these preparations.

The challenge is now on. He fetches each prisoner, one-by-one, into the box room and tells the prisoner that they must find the box that contains their ticket. They attempt to do this by opening boxes. They are allowed to open up to half the boxes in their search. If they succeed in finding their own number, they win. If they have not found their ticket after examining 50 boxes, they fail.

In order for the prisoners to escape, all prisoners have to win. What are their chances of escape?
